so the premise of this project is to slowly approximate a knockoff of WarcraftLogs. Unfortunately, the scope of this project is well beyond my capabilities in a lot of ways. That's fine. I'm just going to walk the scope back to what's achievable.

It's categorically off the table to do nuanced things that WCL does like track healing to a specific target by ability & actor. I'd need actual databases for that, which is beyond me for the moment. Instead, I just want to track healing totals, damage totals, and damage taken totals.
